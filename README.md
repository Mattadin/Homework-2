# Homework-2

## This is a website for Homework Assignment 2

For this website, I've gone for a layout that draws inspiration from several corporate websites
keeping to a more minimalist approach with simple color palettes to draw attention to the content
and increase compatibity for various screen brightness and saturation capabilities.

## The code

Within the code, two primary media-selectors are used to provide compatibility for most tablets
and mobile phones via difference in sizing and formatting of the many flexboxes present to provide
a more coherent user experience for any prospective clients who may be interested.

Within you will find notes detailing which sections affect which part of the code for ease-of-refactor or any additional features that need to be added.
